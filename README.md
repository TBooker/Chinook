# Chinook

Chinook is the name I gave to a set of scripts that I use to generate datasets for the purposes of BIOL525D Bioinformatics for Evolutionary Biologists.

The datasets are based on a simulation of local adaptation in a meta-population of Chinook salmon. The simulation is implemented SLiM, in the simulation we model the evolution of a nucleotide sequence based on the chinook salmon reference genome.

The idea of using simulated datasets is to provide a bit more transparency to students and workshop participants. Using simulations means that we have a ground truth against which to compare our estimates using Bioinformatic approaches. For example, for a *de novo* genome build, we can compare an assembly back to the ground truth so participants can see the limitations and strengths of different approaches.  

Many of the genomic resources required to implement these scripts are not hosted here due to the size limitations of GitHub repos. I've included links to specific datasets.
